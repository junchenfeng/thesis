# Abstract

The age of digital education is dawning. High-speed internet access and smart devices are ubiquitous in social life and only a matter of time before it becomes so in the classroom as well. With the boom of connectivity and computation power comes the blossom of digital learning service and learning data. Never before had the collection of fine-grained individual learning data been so cheap and so abundant. Consequently, the cost of data-driven or evidence-based pedagogical research declines sharply, which opens up new topics that are previously prohibitively expensive or of little importance. This dissertation capitalizes on the availability of fine-grained individual learning data to provide insight into learning engagement and content efficacy, two key components of digital learning service.

This dissertation categorizes learning task into two categories: routine task and comprehension task. The routine task relies on repetition to formulate a reflex response, which requires little knowledge transfer. Learning times table is an example of the routine task. The comprehension task relies on cognitive understanding to transfer knowledge when challenged with a new problem. For instance, learning vertical multiplication is a comprehension task. The mastery of routine task mainly requires persistent practices while the mastery of comprehension task mainly requires high-quality instruction content. 

Chapter one  of the dissertation analyzes the engagement in the routine task practice. The past literature has built effective instruments in estimating the latent proficiency of single task. However, they also built on the false premise that learner will be persistent in practicing until perfect. Learner seldom has the grit to be persistent when confronting with failure. Therefore, the observed practice streak has built-in selection bias. Chapter one introduces a variant of Bayesian knowledge tracing model that jointly models proficiency and persistence.

Chapter two of the dissertation attempts to quantitatively evaluate instructional efficacy at the item level by random control trials. The literature has either focused on the instructional efficacy at the test level, such as value-added model, or the measurement validity at the item level, such as the item response theory. The literature on instructional efficacy at item level is very thin, partly due to the difficulty in collecting such fine-grained learning data. However, item level instructional efficacy is critical for the success of learning recommendation service. Chapter two describes three random controlled experiments that attempt to evaluate the item level content efficacy and collectively they provide some confidence on the consistency and validity of such measurement.

Chapter three  of the dissertation deals with the methodology of continuous improvement by experiments. The online service sector has proved that multi-armed bandit A/B test is a critical tool for continuous quality improvement. Certain aspects of the digital learning service can also benefit from the same methodology. By tolerating Type I error, multi-armed bandit experiment exploits the sequential nature of the online test, decreases sample size and maximizes instructional efficacy. Chapter three compares the analysis result from chapter two with multi-armed bandit experiment simulation to show its practical benefit.
