We analyze two-outcome and multiple-outcome models, including ordered and unordered choice models. We allow for transition-specific and general instruments. We generalize previous analyses by developing weights for treatment effects for general instruments. We develop a simple test for the presence of essential heterogeneity. We note the asymmetry of the model of essential heterogeneity: outcomes of choices are heterogeneous in a general way; choices are not. When both choices and outcomes are permitted to be symmetrically heterogeneous, the method of IV breaks down for estimating treatment parameters.},

  abstract = {We explain and provide examples of a formalism that supports the methodology of discovering how to adapt and personalize technology by combining randomized experiments with variables associated with user models. We characterize a formal relationship between the use of technology to conduct A/B experiments and use of technology for adaptive personalization. The MOOClet Formalism {[}11] captures the equivalence between experimentation and personalization in its conceptualization of modular components of a technology. This motivates a unified software design pattern that enables technology components that can be compared in an experiment to also be adapted based on contextual data, or personalized based on user characteristics. With the aid of a concrete use case, we illustrate the potential of the MOOClet formalism for a methodology that uses randomized experiments of alternative micro-designs to discover how to adapt technology based on user characteristics, and then dynamically implements these personalized improvements in real time.},

  url = {http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2523265},
  abstract = {One goal for massive open online courses is that the educational benefits they provide scale as a function of the number and diversity of learners interacting with the platforms, since an increasing amount of data is available about what interactions and content increase engagement and learning, as well as which educational interactions are effective for which learners, particularly since more and more is known about each individual. This paper presents the MOOClet Framework for tackling this goal, which recognizes a key relationship between randomized experiments and personalization of content. The Framework defines MOOClets as modular components of online courses that can be modified to create different versions, which in turn can be iteratively and adaptively improved through experiments and personalized to characteristics of users. We show how the MOOClet Framework provides guidance in identifying MOOClets and augmenting existing platforms with a platform-independent layer that enables experimentation and personalization even when platforms do not provide native support. We present a concrete usage scenario of the framework in an implementation for the EdX platform, showing how the addition of reflection questions and other content to a lecture video could be experimentally evaluated and personalized. A modeling simulation is also presented to show how using the MOOClet Framework allows data-driven decisions about experimentation and personalization to be made using existing machine learning models. Consideration of the MOOClet Framework could help researchers, instructors, and course designers in identifying, implementing, and improving modular components of existing online education platforms through experimentation and personalization.},

A fundamental asymmetry intrinsic to the method of instrumental variables (IV) is noted. Recent advances in IV estimation allow for heterogeneity in responses but not in choices, and the method breaks down when both choice and response equations are heterogeneous in a general way.},
