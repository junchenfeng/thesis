# A Model of Learning Through Practice {#model}


This chapter constructs the learning through practice (LTP) model in two steps. The first step describes the learning process with a hidden Markov model. The second step adds learner engagement, the stop decision and the effort decision, to the LTP model.

## Notation

This section introduces the symbols used in this chapter. Appendix A gives a full reference of symbols in this thesis.

The practice item id is noted as $j\in\{1,2,\dots,J\}$. The practice sequence id is noted as $t \in \{1,2,\dots,T\}$. The learning is not timed by clock time, but by the number of practice problems done. In the following analysis, "time" and "sequence" are used interchangeably. The assignment of an item to the practice sequence is defined as $A_t$. The latent mastery at each practice opportunity is noted as $X_t$. The observed response at each practice opportunity is noted as $Y_t$. The effort decision at each practice opportunity is noted as $E_t$. The stop decision at each practice opportunity is noted as $H_t$.

For a particular practice sequence with length $T$, denote the joint responses as $\mathbf{Y}_{1,T} = (Y_1,\dots,Y_T)$. Similarly,  $\mathbf{X}_{1,T}$ is the joint latent masteries, $\mathbf{E}_{1,T}$  the joint effort decisions, $\mathbf{H}_{1,T}$  the joint stop decisions, and $\mathbf{A}_{1,T}$  the joint item compositions.Let $\mathbf{y}_{1,T}=(y_1,\dots, y_T)$ be the realized response sequence and $P$ denotes the probability mass function where $P(\mathbf{Y}_{1,T}=\mathbf{y}_{1,T}) = P(Y_1=y_1,\dots, Y_T=y_T)$. Similary, $\mathbf{x}_{1,T}$ is the realized joint latent masteries, $\mathbf{e}_{1,T}$  the realized joint effort decisions, $\mathbf{h}_{1,T}$  the realized joint stop decisions, and $\mathbf{a}_{1,T}$  the realized joint item compositions. For simplicity, when referring to the whole practice sequence, the underscript $1,T$ is dropped throughout the thesis.



## Learning Through Practice without Learner Engagement


### Event Sequence

1. The learner is presented with a practice problem.

2. The learner produces a response based on her state of latent mastery.

3. The learner receives feedback on the observed response.

3. The learner learns (elevates her latent mastery) probabilistically.

4. Repeat from 1.

The current event sequence places learning after the response. Alternatively, one can assume learning happens before the response and during the process of solving the problem. The order has critical implication in inference. If learning happens after the response/feedback, the response to the next problem, rather than response to the current problem, measures the efficacy of the current problem because the latent mastery for solving the current problem is not affected itself. If learning happens before the response/feedback, the response to the current problem measures its own efficacy. The thesis chooses to place learning after the response/feedback because learning from thinking and learning from feedback are complementary. Therefore, the efficacy should measure them as a whole. 

### Assumption for the Learning Process

This section discusses the assumptions needed to represent the learning process as a single dimensional first order Markov process.

**Assumption 1**:  $X_t$ is a unidimenstional ordered discrete variable with $M_x$ number of states.

The unidimensionality assumption avoids the complexity of representing the response as a function of multiple inputs. If the latent mastery is multi-dimensional, the likelihood function of the observed response depends on the question being a single solution with sequential reasoning, multiple solutions with single step reasoning, or multiple steps with sequential reasoning. In addition, each reasoning can house one or more components of the mastery. The unidimensionality assumption also avoids the explosion of pedagogical efficacy parameters. If the latent mastery is multi-dimensional, the state transition matrix of one dimension is unlikely to be independent of all other dimensions. The number of the parameters of the transition matrix explodes exponentially as the dimension of the latent mastery grows.

Readers familiar with the literature of Item Response Theory (IRT) may wonder why the latent mastery is not continuous. The different choices of operational definition are reflected in the shape of item characteristic curve (ICC). The ICC of the LTP model is a step function, whereas the ICC of the IRT model is a smooth sigmoid function. A priori, it is difficult to assert which ICC describes the true data generating process better. There are two scenarios in which the step function fits better. In the first scenario, the true mastery is a discrete variable and the true ICC is a step function. In the second scenario, the true mastery is a continuous variable but the true ICC is a mixture of sigmoid functions. In this case, a single sigmoid function may not fit as well as a flexible step function. As the number of discrete states increases, the step ICC will eventually outperform the single sigmoid ICC. Therefore, assuming the latent mastery as a discrete variable is not very restrictive as long as the number of states is allowed to vary.


Define a operational definition of pedagogical efficacy as the probability of practice item $j$ moving the state of mastery of a learner of type $z$ from $m$ to $n$ ($m\leq n$) at sequence position $t$, after exposing to feedback ($Y_t$) on the current item $j$ and feedback ($\mathbf{Y}_{1,t-1}$) on the preceding items ($\mathbf{A}_{1,t-1}$) in the sequence. Formally, the general efficacy can be written as

$$
P(X_t=n|X_{t-1}=m; Z=z; \mathbf{A}_{1,t-1}, A_t=j; \mathbf{Y}_{1,t-1}, Y_t,;t) \equiv \ell^{z;m,n}_{\mathbf{A}_{1,t-1},j;\mathbf{Y}_{1,t-1},Y_t;t}
$$


To make parameter inference feasible, additional assumptions on the learning context are needed to simplify the efficacy. 

**Assumption 2**: Pedagogical efficacy does not dependent on responses conditional on the previous latent mastery.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&P(X_t=n|X_{t-1}=m; Z=z; \mathbf{A}_{1,t-1}, A_t=j; \mathbf{Y}_{1,t-1}, Y_t,;t) \\
&= P(X_t=n|X_{t-1}=m;Z=z;\mathbf{A}_{1,t-1},A_t=j;t) \quad \forall \mathbf{Y}_{1,t-1}, Y_t
\end{aligned}
$$

It may strike some readers as odd to assume learner learns at the same rate whether or not she solves the problem or not. This is the exact critique of the performance factor analysis model (PFA) [@pavlik2009performance]. However, what stylized fact does the Assumption 2 fails to account for? The proponents of the PFA may argue that Assumption 2 does not generate a positive correlation between successes. This critique is not entirely correct because the successes are positive correlated unconditional on the latent mastery. More previous success implies higher mastery and consequently higher success rate in the future practice. Assumption 2 claims independence only after conditioning on the latent mastery.  The proponents of the PFA may be right to argue that Assumption 2 does not generate high enough positive correlation with an LTP model of binary latent mastery. However, a larger magnitude of the positive correlation may be achieved by allowing the latent mastery to have more states and a positive correlation between efficacy and the state of latent mastery. In short, the assumption 3 greatly reduces the complexity of parameter learning without significantly impairs the model's explanatory power on a learning dataset.


**Assumption 3**: There is no complementarity or substitution effect in the item composition.
$$
\begin{aligned}
&P(X_t=n|X_{t-1}=m;Z=z;\mathbf{A}_{1,t-1},A_t=j;t)\\
&=P(X_t=n|X_{t-1}=m;Z=z;A_t=j;t) \quad \forall \mathbf{A}_{1,t-1}
 \end{aligned}
$$

Assumption 3 rules out scaffolding by preparing a learner with a string of easy problems to solve the final difficult problem. It also rules out a decreasing pedagogical efficacy in the case of naive repetition. If items in the sequence are nearly identical, the learner learns from subsequent practice opportunities with equal probability even if she does not learn from the first attempt.  


**Assumption 4**: The pedagogical efficacy is independent of the sequence position.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&P(X_t=n|X_{t-1}=m;Z=z;A_t=j;t)\\
&=P(X_t=n|X_{t-1}=m;Z=z;A_t=j) \quad \forall t
\end{aligned}
$$

Assumption 4 claims that a learner has the same probability of learning whether the item is the first one in the sequence or the last one. It essentially assumes that the learner is a paragon of grit and positive psychology. She is never frustrated by failures, never bored by repetition, and can focus as long as it takes.

In short, after Assumption 2 to Assumption 4, the general efficacy $\ell^{z;m,n}_{\mathbf{A}_{1,t-1},j;\mathbf{Y}_{1,t-1},Y_t;t}$ can be reduced to $\ell^{z;m,n}_{j}$. It is the working defition of pedagogical efficacy for the rest of the thesis.

**Assumption 5**: The latent mastery never regresses.

$$
p(X_t=m|Z=z,X_{t-1}=n;A_t=j)=0 \quad \forall t,z,j \quad\text{where} \quad m < n
$$

Assumption 5 is sensible if the learning process in question is a short term training with intense practice. Therefore, the LTP model is not suitable for long-term skill acquisition or memory retention.


### The Observed Response

Conditioning on learner type $z$, latent mastery $X_t$, and the item assignment $A_t$, the response is generated by a multinomial distribution. The probability of observing response $r$ is  

$$
P(Y_{t}=r|Z=z,X_t=k,A_t=j) \equiv c^{z;r,k}_{j}
$$

**Assumption 6**: The distribution of observed response conditional the latent mastery is the same for all user types.

$$
P(Y_{t}=r|X_t=k,A_t=j) = P(Y_{t}=r|Z=z,X_t=k,A_t=j) \quad \forall z
$$
Under Assumption 6, the probability mass function of the observed response follows $c^{r,k}_j$.


The learner heterogeneity tries to capture the differential responses to the instruction rather than the differential responses to the assessment. If there is only one way to solve the problem, given the same latent mastery level, the probability of solving the problem should be the same.


### Example: the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing Model

The classic Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model is a special case of the LTP model thus constructed. It has one learner type ($M_Z=1$) and one item ($J=1$). The latent mastery has two states ($M_X=2$) and the observed response has two levels ($M_Y=2$). The BKT model is described by the following four parameters: initial mastery ($\pi$), learning rate ($\ell$), guess rate ($g$), and slip rate ($s$). Their definition and corresponding notation in the LTP model are listed below.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\pi &= P(X_1=1)\\
\ell &= P(X_t=1|X_{t-1}=0) \equiv \ell^{1;0,1}_1\\
g &= P(Y_t=1|X_t=0) \equiv c^{1,0}_1\\
s &= P(Y_t=0|X_t=1) \equiv 1-c^{1,1}_1
\end{aligned}
$$


## Learning Through Practice With Learner Engagement

The previous section implicitly assumes that the learner can engage in learning for as long as the instructor wishes and as focused as the learning task requires. Both the duration and the intensity of learner engagement are imperfect in a low stake learning environment, which is typical of most applications of the intelligent tutoring system. This section uses the stop decision to describe the duration of learner engagement and the effort decision to describe the intensity of learner engagement. The LTP model from the previous section is extended to incorporate these decisions.

### Event Sequence

1. The learner is presented with a practice question.

2. The learner exerts a level of effort based on her state of latent mastery

3. The learner produces a response based on the effort level and her state of latent mastery. 

4. The learner receives feedback on the observed response.

5. If the learner has exerted effort, she learns probabilistically. Otherwise, she does not learn.

6. The learner can choose or be forced to exit. If the learner continues, repeat from (1); else data collection stops.


### The Effort Decision

**Assumption 6:** The effort is a binary choice with value 0 for not exerting effort and 1 for exerting effort.

**Assumption 7:** Conditional on the type of the learner, the state of latent mastery and the item id, the probability of exerting effort is constant.

$$
P(E_t=1|Z=z, X_t=k, A_t=j) \equiv \gamma_{j}^{z;k}
$$


The level of effort is important because it determines practice efficacy and the observed response. Motivated by the intuition of "no pain no gain", if the learner does not exert effort, the pedagogical efficacy is always zero. 

**Assumption 8**: $P(X_t=n|X_{t-1}=m, Z=z, A_t=j, E_t=0) = 0 \quad \forall z,t,j, \text{and }m > n$

Furthermore, assume that if the learner does not exert effort, the response is always completely incorrect. 

**Assumption 9**: $P(Y_t=0|E_t=0,A_t=j) = 1  \quad \forall j,t$

### The Stop Decision

The hazard rate at sequence $t$ is the probability of stop practicing conditional on continuing the practice at sequence $t-1$. 

$$
h \equiv P(H_t=1|H_{t-1}=0)
$$
Whether hazard rates depend on the response or the latent mastery merits a brief discussion. The issue is examined in details in Chapter 5. There are two types of stop decisions: stop-by-rule and stop-by-choice. An example of stop-by-rule is the "X-Strike" rule: A learner always keeps practicing unless she is forced to stop after accumulating X successes/failures. An example of stop-by-choice is the differential impact of boredom and frustration [@baker2010better]: A learner without mastery is frustrated by further practice while a learner with mastery is bored by it. In the case of stop-by-rule, the stop decision can only depend on the responses because they are what the system observes. In the case of stop-by-choice, the stop decision can reasonably depend on either the response or the latent mastery, but more likely the latter. Therefore, this thesis equates the stop-by-rule decision with a response dependent hazard model and the stop-by-choice decision with a mastery dependent hazard model.


Furthermore, the functional form of hazard rate curve can be specified as parametric or nonparametric. Continue with the previous two examples. If the stop decision is stop-by-rule, hazard rates are likely to be non-monotonic in time. It is reasonable to specify a nonparametric functional form for the hazard function 

$$
 P(H_t=1|H_{t-1}=0,Y_t=r)= h_t^r
$$

In contrast, if the stop decision is stop-by-choice, it is not clear what functional form the hazard function should be. It is possible to model the duration dependence as a proportional hazard model.

$$
P(H_t=1|H_{t-1}=0,Z=z,X_t=k) = \lambda_{z;k} e^{\beta_{z;k} t} 
$$

while it is also reasonable to just assume a non-parametric functional form.

$$
 P(H_t=1|H_{t-1}=0,Z=z,X_t=k)= h_t^{z;k}
$$

If the data generating process of the stop decision is parametric, both specifications are consistent but the parametric specification is efficient. Otherwise, the non-parametric specification is consistent while the parametric specification is inconsistent.

Last but not least, this thesis assumes that stop decision does not dependent on the item assignment, which greatly reduces the number of parameters.


**Assumption 10**: Stop decision is independent of item characteristics


## Express Learning Theories with the LTP model

Because the LTP model relaxes the constraint of the restrictive structural representation of the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model, it can have an arbitrary representation of the learning process, to the extent that the data allows for unique identification. To avoid abusing the LTP model as a pure data mining exercise, the representation of the learning process should be guided by learning theories. By the same token, because the LTP model is capable of expressing the testable implications of learning theories, the researcher can decide if the learning data fit her choice of the learning theory. Although this thesis does not carry out the empirical test, it is meaningful to point out the possibility of doing such test.


### Zone of Proximal Development

The zone of proximal development [@vygotsky1978interaction] postulates three types of relationship between the mental development of a learner and the mental requirement of a learning task. If the learner's mental development lags the mental requirement of the learning task, the learning is slow, the engagement is low, and the performance is poor. If the learner's mental development falls shorts of the requirement of the learning task if when she works independently but within her reach under the guidance or in collaboration, the learning speeds up, the engagement is high, and the performance improves. This is the zone of proximal development. If the learner's mental development exceeds the requirement of the task, the performance is high albeit there is no learning.

This theory naturally calls for a three-state latent mastery ($M_x=3$). It has empirically testable implications on the observed response and the effort rate. If the learner is not ready to learn ($X=0$), she will fail the problem with high probability, exert little effort, and has no chance to suddenly master the skill.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(Y_t=0|X_t=0) &\approx 1\\
P(E_t=0|X_t=0) &\approx 1\\
P(X_t=2|X_{t-1}=0) &\approx 0\\
\end{aligned}
$$

If the learner has achieved mastery ($X=2$), she will not fail the problem completely.
$$
P(Y_t=0|X_t=2) \approx 0
$$

If the learner is in the zone of the proximal development ($X=1$), the learning process has no obvious constraints implied by Vygotsky's theory.


### Reinforcement Learning

The observation that people repeat actions that reward them with pleasure and avoid actions that punish them with pain is well-established in cognitive science. Reinforcement learning is not only a stylized fact of how we learn [@anderson2000learning] but may also be the biological foundation of how we learn [@holroyd2002neural]. In the context of learning through practice, reinforcement learning means that the more successes a learner get, the more engaged she is; the more failures a learner gets, the less engaged she is.

For the practice duration, if the stop decision depends on the latent mastery and the hazard rate is negatively correlated with the latent mastery, the LTP model generates the following pattern: The more successes the learner has in the preceding sequence, the more likely she is going to continue practice; the more failures the learner has in the preceding sequence, the less likely she is going to continue practice. This pattern arises because a higher rate of success implies a higher level of mastery, and consequently a lower probability to stop. 

The same is true for the practice intensity. If the effort rate is positively correlated with the latent mastery, unconditional on the latent mastery, the more success the learner has enjoyed, the more effort she is likely to put into practice; the more failures the learner has suffered, the less effort she is likely to exert. This pattern arises because a higher rate of success implies a higher level of mastery and consequently a higher probability to exert effort.


## Adaptive Practice Recommendation Based on the LTP model

The classical Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model cannot generate adaptive practice recommendations within a knowledge/skill domain. This somewhat surprising result is a consequence of the homogeneous learning assumption imposed by the BKT model: If the learner has no mastery, she learns with a constant learning rate. If the learner has mastery, she does not learn. To highlight the problematic implication of this assumption, consider an extreme case that a college freshman and a first grader learn first order differentiation. According to the assumption of the BKT model, if both learners have not learned the skill, they learn at the same rate for any given material. 

This defect does not harm the Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) developed in the United States too much because major US ITSs focus on between domain objective individualization rather than within domain practice individualization. Use the math learning as an example. The ITS tries to sequence learning objectives that the learner needs to master in an optimal way. For instances, Khan Academy builds a knowledge tree and encourages learners to pass the test on parent nodes first before proceeding to their children nodes. The Cognitive Tutor follows a similar strategy to break a large learning goal into smaller skill-building blocks. Assessments and Learning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS) system adaptively changes the next learning objective given the learner's accomplished objectives. For objective individualization, the key question is what pre-requisite objectives the learner should achieve to ensure that the current objective is attainable [@doignon2012knowledge] and if such process does describe how people learn to acquire certain skills [@anderson2013language]. Within the learning objective, the practice question is usually generated by an algorithm rather than selected from a pre-existing content library. These computer-generated practice items are highly substitutable, thus the question is whether the practice engine is effective rather than which question the engine generated is most effective [@ritter2007cognitive]. Therefore, practice individualization within a knowledge domain is not the major concern for the learning analytics community.

However, for some education service providers, the main problem is not objective individualization but practice individualization. Consider the problem of helping a teacher compile a homework from an existing content pool. The learning objective sequencing is set by the teacher (or the curriculum), while the item sequencing is left to the algorithm. The BKT model family is not very useful for solving the item sequencing problem, so some service providers, such as Knewton, resort back to the literature of computerized adaptive testing, which may not be a good framework for instructional recommendations because it assumes no learning possible in the first place.

The LTP model addresses the problem of practice individualization by introducing learner's heterogeneous gain from practice. The construction of practice efficacy ($\ell^{z;m,n}_j$) defines two types of learner heterogeneity. The state heterogeneity refers to differential learning gains for learners with different levels of mastery conditional on the same learner type. The type heterogeneity refers to differential learning gains for learners with different types conditional on the same mastery level. Reconsider the previous "learning first order differentiation" example. With three levels of mastery inspired by Vygotsky's zone of proximal development, the first grader is defined as level-1 mastery who is not ready to learn, the college freshman is defined as level-2 mastery who is ready to learn but not proficient in the skill yet. The instruction has little efficacy on the level 1 learners but some efficacy on the level-2 learners. This is called state heterogeneity. For the college freshmen, some may be more versed in the mathematical reasoning than others, therefore the instruction may have different efficacies on learners with different susceptibilities. This is called type heterogeneity.

The learner engagement component of the LTP model introduces another dimension to practice individualization. Because item differs in its effort appeal condition on the type and the mastery state of the learner, there exists state heterogeneity and type heterogeneity in the effort appeal of the item as well. In general, the optimal practice item is both high in practice efficacy and strong in effort appeal. Heterogeneities on both aspects can give rise to a rich set of recommendation strategies.
